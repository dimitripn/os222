Website that I think useful:

1. [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)<br>
I think Grammarly is useful because it can make our writing better.
It checks every word in our writing for spelling errors.
Especially for a course that use English language like this.

2. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)<br>
I think Youtube is also useful to help me understand this course.
Because there are a lot of videos in there that I can watch to study about this course.

3. [Linux Command Cheat Sheet](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html)<br>
I think this website is useful because it can help me resolve some problem in Linux.
