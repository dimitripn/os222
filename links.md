Website that I think useful:

1. [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)<br>
I think Grammarly is useful because it can make our writing better.
It checks every word in our writing for spelling errors.
Especially for a course that use English language like this.

2. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)<br>
I think Youtube is also useful to help me understand this course.
Because there are a lot of videos in there that I can watch to study about this course.

3. [Linux Command Cheat Sheet](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html)<br>
I think this website is useful because it can help me resolve some problem in Linux.

4. [Basic Vi Commands](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-7612/editorvi-43/index.html)<br>
I thinks it's very useful for modifying text in linux.

5. [Bash in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g)<br>
This is the video that I found in Youtube that I think very useful because it can help me to understand about bash more.

6. [Linux in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/rrB13utjYV4)<br>
This is also the video that I found in Youtube that I think useful because it can gelp me to understand about linux more.

7. [File System Concept in Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzUyMy7Ihk0)<br>
This is important for me because it helps me learn the fundamental concept of file system.

8. [How to compile your C file using Makefile](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)<br>
This is also good because it contains a tutorial of compiling C programming file using makefile.
